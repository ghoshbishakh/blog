Hi I am Bishakh Ghosh, an undergrad student at [National Institute of Technology, Durgapur](http://nitdgp.ac.in)

I am trying to be a developer and the tools I generally use are python, Django, HTML5, CSS3, bootstrap, JavaScript, JQuery, C.... and many more here and there.

Also I have implemented some network protocols with UDP and built some tools under awesome guidance of the [professors of MCN Research group](http://www.nitdgp.ac.in/MCN-RG/mcn-rg.html).

This is the blog is where I will try to document some interesting stuff that I come accross while building stuff and fixing(/breaking) them.
